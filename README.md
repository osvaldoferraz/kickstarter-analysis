## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Best month to begin a Fundraising Kickstart Campaign for Theater is May.
The worst month to begin a Fundraising Kickstart Campaign for Theater is December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Most successful Fundraising Kickstart campaigns for Theater had goals below $5000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The table does not have enough information to draw conclusions in an accurate way.
For example, Outcomes Based on Goal graph can give a false impression on the outcomes, because the data is not properly weighted. 
It shows that 73-76% of the kickstartes goals below $5000 were successful, seconded by goals from $35000 to $45000, with a success rate of 67%.
However, the Kickstart table gives a sample of 317 Successful entries below $5000, but only 6 succesful entries with goals between $35000 and $45000 (see below)
This discrepancy between these two samples gives a false impression that goals between 35-45k can be almost as successful than its pair below 5k, which is not necessarily truth.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
