# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns data to uncover trends
---
The purpose of this analysis is to help finding trends to have a successful Kickstarter campaing to fund a Theater play in the U.S, comparing also some data on specific plays from Great Brittain.
Using a Data Set from more then 4000 plays around the globe, after cleaning and filtering the data, and aplying statistics concepts, I was able to draw conclusions regarding:
- The ideal target goal value.
- The ideal time of the year for the Kickstarter campaign
- The ideal lenght of the Kickstarter campaing

Each of these points will be explained below.
