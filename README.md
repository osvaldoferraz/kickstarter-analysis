# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analysis of a Data Set based on fundrasing campaings around the globe.

### Purpose
Louise is a playwriter that wants information on how she can get the best outcome for her play *Fever* Kickstarter Fundraising Campaing. To achieve that, she wanted to know how launch dates and funding goals would impact the success of the fundraiser.

## Analysis and Challenges
In order to answer Louise's questions, I used the Kickstarter Data Set to gather information about the outcomes based on launch dates and also outcomes based on goals.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For this analysis, I created a Pivot Table that summarized all the final outcomes - Success, Failed and Cancelled - for the plays, against months of the year that those plays had started their campaigns. This sample ranges from 2009 to 2017, totalling 1369 campigns, an amount that can give a good idea about the seasonality of these successful events.

To make the results clear, a line graph was created that clearly shows in what months we have the most successful campaings and also the most unsucceful ones too.

Based on this graph, seasonality plays an important role in successful campaigns, with a big spike in the month of May bringing the most number of succesfull campaings. It is also worthwihle to notice that December is a month with very few successfull outcomes.
Seasonality does not seem to play a hughe role on failed campaigns though, as the line is almost the same during the whole year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Best month to begin a Fundraising Kickstart Campaign for Theater is May.
The worst month to begin a Fundraising Kickstart Campaign for Theater is December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Most successful Fundraising Kickstart campaigns for Theater had goals below $5000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The table does not have enough information to draw conclusions in an accurate way.
For example, Outcomes Based on Goal graph can give a false impression on the outcomes, because the data is not properly weighted. 
It shows that 73-76% of the kickstartes goals below $5000 were successful, seconded by goals from $35000 to $45000, with a success rate of 67%.
However, the Kickstart table gives a sample of 317 successful entries below $5000, but only 6 succesful entries with goals between $35000 and $45000 (see below)
This discrepancy between these two samples gives a false impression that goals between 35-45k can be almost as successful than its pair below 5k, which is not necessarily truth.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
